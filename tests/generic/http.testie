Use WRK to requests file ranging from 1K to 1G using WRK.

Note that the HTTP server to use is not included in this test, only
the request maker (WRK) and creating the file for the server in the
HTTP_ROOT path

Roles to set : client, server and dut. Dut is probably equal to server in most cases, but some times you want to address a NAT or PROXY (which would be the DUT) and not the server directly.
